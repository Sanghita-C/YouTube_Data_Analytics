# YouTube_Data_Analytics

üìù Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline to extract, process, analyze, and visualize YouTube trending videos across multiple regions. Using Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, Google BigQuery, and Streamlit, we will develop a scalable system to track video engagement trends, regional differences, and popular content categories over time.

This pipeline is fully automated and ensures efficient data ingestion, transformation, and real-time visualization of YouTube's trending content.
